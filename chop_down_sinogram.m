% CHOP_DOWN_SINOGRAM
% -------------------------------------------------------------------------
% Function used to reduce the number of projection images in a sinogram by
% sampling. Use if you need to reduce the size of your data set for testing
% or performance reasons. Use in conjuction with chop_down_angles to reduce
% the number of projection angles in the corresponding projection angles list. 
% 
% TESTED ENVIRONMENT:
%   Windows 10, MATLAB version 2017a
% 
% INPUT:
%   sinogram - a matrix containing the sinogram you want to sample from
%   factor - the sampling factor 
% 
% OUTPUT:
%   sinogram_chopped - the sampled sinogram
