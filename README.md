# Laminography
MATLAB code for laminography reconstruction using SIRT and CGLS

This software is used for reconstruction of laminography data from a standard microCT scanner. This software was developed and used in the scanning and reconstruction process of a test object using the laminography method. This work was published in the the journal Measurement Science and Technology titled Laminography in the lab: Imaging planar objects using a conventional x-ray CT scanner (2019) (see https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6501/aafcae).
